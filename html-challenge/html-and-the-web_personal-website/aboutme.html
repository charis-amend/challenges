    <p>
      I have extensive experience working in both SaaS, mobile apps and start-up
      environments. During my time as Product Owner for "Deutschrap Quiz," I led
      the development and launch of a mobile app. I gained valuable experience
      in the start-up landscape whilst being self-employed and working at IDAGIO
      GmbH and Bitfury Surround GmbH. I was involved in creating a SaaS tool for
      the blockchain music market, which required a deep understanding of the
      SaaS industry. Furthermore, my role as an Innovation Manager at Sony Music
      Entertainment, I was immersed in the start-up culture, working on several
      MVPs as a product manager for the organization's growth and development.
